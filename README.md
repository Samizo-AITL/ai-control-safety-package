# AI Control Safety Package

🚧 **Currently under development.**  
This package is **not yet offered as a deployable or commercial solution**.
It is being prepared as a design and governance framework, and real-world
engagements have not yet been conducted.

This site provides a **practical design package** for introducing  
AI / LLM-based control systems **safely and responsibly**.

We focus on **risk, safety boundaries, and recovery**,  
**not** performance optimization.

## What this package is

- A **design and review framework** for AI-assisted control systems
- A clear definition of **where AI can be used**
- A clear definition of **where AI must be stopped**
- A structured way to ensure systems **recover safely when things go wrong**

This package targets **industrial control, embedded systems,  
and long-term operation environments**.

---

## What this package is NOT

- We do **NOT** optimize control performance
- We do **NOT** replace existing PID or classical controllers
- We do **NOT** place LLMs inside real-time control loops
- We do **NOT** provide safety certification

This is a **design-level safety and reliability package**.

## Packages

### 1. AI Control Risk Review
Architectural **Go / Conditional Go / No-Go** judgment  
for AI / LLM-based control concepts.

- AI placement outside real-time loops
- Stop conditions and fallback paths
- Responsibility and failure handling clarity

🔗 **Open:**  
[risk-review.md](https://samizo-aitl.github.io/ai-control-safety-package/packages/risk-review.html)

---

### 2. Safety Envelope Design
Explicit definition and enforcement of  
**operational boundaries AI must not violate**.

- Allowed operational regions (envelopes)
- Pre-violation detection
- FSM-based supervisory enforcement

🔗 **Open:**  
[safety-envelope.md](https://samizo-aitl.github.io/ai-control-safety-package/packages/safety-envelope.html)

---

### 3. Recovery Control Design
Deterministic recovery design after  
disturbances, degradation, or abnormal behavior.

- Recovery modes
- Safe fallback paths
- Controlled re-entry and re-identification

🔗 **Open:**  
[recovery-control.md](https://samizo-aitl.github.io/ai-control-safety-package/packages/recovery-control.html)

## Engagement & Fees (Guideline)

This package is provided as a **limited-scope design review and consulting service**  
focused on **architecture, responsibility, and safety logic**.

The following fees reflect:
- Design-level assessment only (no implementation or coding)
- No certification, operational guarantee, or liability assumption
- Time-bounded, clearly scoped engagement
- Explicit Go / Conditional Go / No-Go judgment where applicable

### Service Menu

- **AI Control Risk Review**  
  from **JPY 50,000 – 100,000**  
  *(Architecture review, responsibility definition, Go / No-Go judgment)*

- **Safety Envelope Design**  
  from **JPY 100,000 – 300,000**  
  *(Operational boundary definition, supervisory logic, enforcement actions)*

- **Recovery Control Design**  
  from **JPY 150,000 – 400,000**  
  *(Recovery triggers, fallback structure, deterministic re-entry design)*

Fees depend on system complexity, documentation availability,  
and required depth of review.

## Where to start

If you are unsure where to begin,  
**AI Control Risk Review** is recommended as the first step.

---

## Who should use this

- Control engineers under pressure to introduce AI / LLM
- Technical leads responsible for safety and reliability
- Teams requiring a defensible **Go / No-Go** decision
- Organizations that must explain **why AI is limited or disabled**
